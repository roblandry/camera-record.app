 *  Description: This app was designed to work with the Android IP Camera device (http://github.com/roblandry/android-ip-camera.device). 
 *  You can record video or take a burst of photos when a trigger is activated. Acceptable triggers are motion, contact, acceleration, 
 *  switch, presence, smoke, water, button, modechange, and schedule. There is also a time delay to allow the camera to continue recording 
 *  once the trigger has stopped (ie. motion ceased, continue recording for 5 minutes).
